Hi and welcome to my website. I don't know what I have created but I am new to it. I edited this today to make it seem like I know a lot of stuff about website design but I do not.

I am scared.

Wait so how do I use commit? I open both brackets and github on my laptop? And then what??? Ohhh I just edit the readme file and commit to main on the github desktop app???????? Seems easy enough right? WRONG

Actually it ain't that bad now that I have actually done it.
